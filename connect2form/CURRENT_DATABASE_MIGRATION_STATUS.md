## ðŸ”„ REMAINING WORK

### Files Still Requiring Database Migration:

#### 1. High Priority - Integration Files:
- `addons/integrations-manager/src/Integrations/Mailchimp/AnalyticsManager.php` - Contains ~15 direct database calls
- `addons/integrations-manager/src/Integrations/Mailchimp/BatchProcessor.php` - Contains ~8 direct database calls
- `addons/integrations-manager/src/Integrations/Mailchimp/WebhookHandler.php` - âœ… 1 direct database call migrated (1 remaining)
- `addons/integrations-manager/src/Integrations/Hubspot/HubspotIntegration.php` - Contains ~5 direct database calls
- `addons/integrations-manager/src/Integrations/Hubspot/AnalyticsManager.php` - Contains ~10 direct database calls

#### 2. Medium Priority - Admin Controllers:
- `addons/integrations-manager/src/Admin/Controllers/IntegrationsController.php` - Contains ~3 direct database calls

#### 3. Low Priority - Other Files:
- `addons/integrations-manager/src/Core/Services/ErrorHandler.php` - Contains ~1 direct database call
- `addons/integrations-manager/src/Core/Plugin.php` - Contains ~1 direct database call

## ðŸ“Š ESTIMATED REMAINING DIRECT DATABASE CALLS: ~44

**Note**: The user reported "about 120 times DirectQuery error are occures" - this may include:
1. Multiple instances of the same call in different contexts
2. Calls within loops or repeated operations
3. Calls in template files that get included multiple times

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions:
1. âœ… **COMPLETED**: Fix duplicate method declaration in FormService
2. ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS**: Migrate remaining integration files to use ServiceManager
3. ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED**: Test all migrated functionality to ensure no breaking changes

### Migration Strategy:
1. **AnalyticsManager Files**: These are complex and contain many analytics queries. Consider creating dedicated AnalyticsService classes.
2. **BatchProcessor**: Migrate to use existing services where possible.
3. **WebhookHandler**: Simple migrations to use existing services.
4. **HubspotIntegration**: Continue migration of remaining methods.

### Testing Required:
- Form creation, editing, and deletion
- Submission handling and viewing
- Integration settings and functionality
- Analytics and reporting features
- Import/export functionality

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL NOTES

1. **Fallback Strategy**: All migrations include fallbacks to direct `wpdb` calls if ServiceManager is not available
2. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality should continue to work
3. **Performance**: Service classes include caching for better performance
4. **Error Handling**: All service methods include proper error handling

## ðŸ“ˆ PROGRESS SUMMARY

- **Main Plugin Files**: 100% Complete âœ…
- **Service Classes**: 100% Complete âœ…  
- **Addon Files**: ~70% Complete ðŸ”„
- **Total Estimated Progress**: ~85% Complete

**Estimated Time to Complete**: 2-3 hours of focused work to migrate remaining ~45 direct database calls.
